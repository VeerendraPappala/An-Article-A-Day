# An-Article-A-Day

## Day-1 | Build Book Recommender Systems. 


![book-shelf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45025357/52583901-b168a080-2e56-11e9-8ab2-511ace369f80.jpg)

  **Article Is about Building Recommendation System for Books using Booksdata Set.** 
  
* Virtually everyone has had an online experience where a website makes personalized recommendations. Amazon tells you “Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought”, Udemy tells you “Students Who Viewed This Course Also Viewed”. Building recommender systems today requires specialized expertise in analytics, machine learning and software engineering, and learning new skills and tools is difficult and time-consuming.

## Day-3 | Time Forecast using  Tpot Automated ML in python

![tpot-logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45025357/52727507-5f9d5300-2fdb-11e9-99b7-d86acc80f44a.jpg)

**Article is about Time Forecast Using TPOT- An automated Machine Learning In Python**

* TPOT is meant to be an assistant that gives you ideas on how to solve a particular machine learning problem by exploring pipeline configurations that you might have never considered, then leaves the fine-tuning to more constrained parameter tuning techniques such as grid search.

* So TPOT helps you find good algorithms. Note that it isn’t designed for automating deep learning — something like AutoKeras might be helpful there.
* AutoML algorithms aren’t as simple as fitting one model on the dataset; they are considering multiple machine learning algorithms (random forests, linear models, SVMs, etc.) in a pipeline with multiple preprocessing steps (missing value imputation, scaling, PCA, feature selection, etc.), the hyperparameters for all of the models and preprocessing steps, as well as multiple ways to ensemble or stack the algorithms within the pipeline.

* There are so many interesting directions to explore with TPOT and autoML. I’d like to compare TPOT with autoSKlearn, MLBox, Auto-Keras, and others. I’d also like to see how it performs with a greater variety of data, other imputation strategies, and other encoding strategies. A comparison with LightGBM, CatBoost , and deep learning algorithms would also be interesting. 

* For More info info Read the complete [Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/time-forecast-with-tpot-b2d87eaba59c) & [Documentation](http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/using/)

**Article is Restnet used  with pytorch to classify German Traffic Board signs using Fastai in Python** 

* PyTorch was one of the most popular frameworks in 2018.PyTorch is a Python based scientific computing package that is similar to NumPy, but with the added power of GPUs. It is also a deep learning framework that provides maximum flexibility and speed during implementing and building deep neural network architectures.

* The FastAi library is a high level library build on PyTorch, which allows us to build models using only a few lines of code.The FastAI library provides a lot of different datasets which can be loaded in directly, but it also provides functionality for downloading images given a file containing the urls of these images.

* Fastai  allows us to perform transfer learning with less code and time by giving us the ability to set different learning rates for different parts in the network. This allows us to train the earlier layers less than the latter layers.

*  k-means clustering aims to converge on an optimal set of cluster centers (centroids) and cluster membership based on distance from these centroids via successive iterations, it is intuitive that the more optimal the positioning of these initial centroids, the fewer iterations of the k-means clustering algorithms will be required for convergence.

* Binary classification involves classifying the data into two groups, e.g. whether or not a customer buys a particular product or not (Yes/No), based on independent variables such as gender, age, location etc.
* As the target variable is not continuous, binary classification model predicts the probability of a target variable to be Yes/No.

* CNNs have wide applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems and natural language processing. 
CNNs, like neural networks, are made up of neurons with learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives several inputs, takes a weighted sum over them, pass it through an activation function and responds with an output.
* Today, I've practised how to implement CNN with Keras

## Day-20 | Essentials of Deep Learning – Sequence to Sequence modelling with Attention (using python)

![sequence modeling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45025357/53682306-769dae00-3d1a-11e9-9b2f-9241929f128f.png)


* We know that to solve sequence modelling problems, Recurrent Neural Networks is our go-to architecture.
* Suppose you have a series of statements:

Joe went to the kitchen. Fred went to the kitchen. Joe picked up the milk.
Joe travelled to the office. Joe left the milk. Joe went to the bathroom.

And you have been asked the below question:

Where was Joe before the office?

* The appropriate answer would be “kitchen”. A quick glance makes this seem like a simple problem. But to understand the complexity – there are two dimensions which the system has to understand:

* The underlying working of the English language and the sequence of characters/words which make up the sentence
The sequence of events which revolve around the people mentioned in the statements
This can be considered as a sequence modelling problem, as understanding the sequence is important to make any prediction around it.

## Day-21 | Lingvo: A TensorFlow Framework for Sequence Modeling

* Lingvo is the international language Esperanto word for “language”. This naming alludes to the roots of the Lingvo framework — it was developed as a general deep learning framework using TensorFlow with a focus on sequence models for language-related tasks such as machine translation, speech recognition, and speech synthesis.
* Above picture demontrates an overview of the Lingvo framework, outlining how models are instantiated, trained, and exported for evaluation and serving.

## Day-26 | An Excessively Deep Dive Into Natural Gradient Optimization

* All modern deep learning models are trained using gradient descent. At each step of gradient descent, your parameter values begin at some starting point, and you move them in the direction of greatest loss reduction. 
* You do this by taking the derivative of your loss with respect to your whole vector of parameters, otherwise called the Jacobian. 
* However, this is just the first derivative of your loss, and it doesn’t tell you anything about curvature, or, how quickly your first derivative is changing. More about article is below.
